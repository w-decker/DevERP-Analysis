Analysis code used to in the [DevERP Simplified](https://github.com/w-decker/DevERP-Simplified) project.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: The current work is **in progress** and a cohesive file structure has not yet been created.
  - Filenames with devERP_<task>_<parameter>.m are the MATLAB files used to analyze data at each step for a certain task.
  - To test significant, a tmax permutation was conducted on to test the null hypothesis that the grandaverages voltage of bins are different from mu (0). This computation makes use of the [Mass Univariate Toolbox](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Mass_Univariate_ERP_Toolbox:_Appendix#tmaxGND).
  - I expect to have a finalized repo structure by the end of July or beginning of August.
